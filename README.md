## Project Idea
We will use Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results. Given the trained Face Mask Detection for a Virus Research Lab, we will proceed to implement additional Python scripts used to: Detect Face Mask Detection for a Virus Research Lab form the face masks detection in real-time video streams.
### Motivation
Face mask detection is the process of determining whether or not someone is wearing a mask. We all know that wearing masks is one of the most effective ways to prevent the virus from spreading. Despite this, we notice a lot of people not wearing masks in public locations. Using AI approaches to construct a system that can recognize persons who arenâ€™t wearing masks could be a solution to this problem.
### Scope
Where face mask is mandatory
### Platform
Face Mask Detection Platform uses Artificial Network to recognize if a user is not wearing a mask.  The app can be connected to any existing or new IP mask detection cameras to detect people without a mask. 
### Project Brief
For building face mask based door system, we used machine learning model using Keras, Tensorflow library in python language. After building model we used OpenCV to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real time. This system contains mainly three devices. They are: servo, camera (webcam), and Arduino Uno. We used arduino Uno to control servo and camera. If someone appears in front of the entrance wearing a mask properly, covering both their mouth and nose, then they will be let in. But if someone appears without a mask then they will be denied entry. This versatile system could be used with variety of entrances with different locking system.
